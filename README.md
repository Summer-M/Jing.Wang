The ultimate goal of the Repo is to create a visual learning platform, to help computer novice to learn about the data structure and algorithm, etc.And hope to be able to clear the principle of some algorithms, access the process of data structure for computer.According to the ideal,can reduce the cost of some kind of learning.

#   · Purpose
    1 . This Repo make me keep coding practice,does not become rusty about some "coding techniques" 
        or "coding thinking"
    2 . Basic skills are very very important for programmer( i think )
    3 . Develop a good coding habits
    4 . Keep the sensitivity of programming technology
#   · Tools
    1 . Use Microsoft visual studio 2015 community
    2 . Use Git version 1.8.0-preview20121022
    3 . Use Doxygen
    4 . Use Some Books ( C++ Primer Plus / C++ Primer / Introduction to Algorithms , or some oj,etc)
